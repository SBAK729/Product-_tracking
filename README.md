# üõçÔ∏è AI-Based Product Recommendation System with Data Visualization and Tracking

## üìñ Problem Description

In the competitive e-commerce landscape, sellers often face challenges in understanding the dominant trends and preferences of the market. Without insights into the needs and expectations of major buyers, sellers may offer products that fail to align with consumer demand, leading to reduced sales, unsold inventory, and missed growth opportunities.

To succeed, sellers must adapt their offerings based on accurate data about their target audience‚Äôs preferences, ensuring their products resonate with major buyers driving the market. Identifying and catering to these needs is essential for maintaining relevance and achieving sustainable success.

## üí° Solution Description

This project aims to develop a comprehensive AI-driven product recommendation system designed to enhance both user and seller experiences. The system will utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior, preferences, and purchase history, delivering personalized product suggestions.
